# Gungnir
Gungnir is a tool to download and analyzing free XR applications from SideQuest Marketplace, developed by Anfonso R. Barredo-Valenzuela while at IMDEA Networks. It is composed by two functionalities. First a Crawler used for searching and Gathering APKs. Second, an script to extract relevant information from the extracted dataset.

## Requirements 
The use of this software requires having several items before.
- HARDWARE
    - Meta Headset (e.g., Meta Quest 3) in Developer mode.
- SOFTWARE
    - **SideQuest Desktop** app installed in the PC.
        - User account credentials have to be provided filled in at `./crawler/configuration.py`. 
    - **Google Chrome** installed (if you want you can change the selenium driver for using another browser).
    - **Il2CppDumper**
    - **Jadx**
    - (Optional) Having installed the Meta Developer Hub.

For the python scripts run this command for installing dependencies: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Usage

Any of them require further inputs than the those in the configuration files.

## Results

The APKs gathered by the crawler are stored in `./Data/APKs`. The results of the analysis are in the folder `./graphs/freq`.
